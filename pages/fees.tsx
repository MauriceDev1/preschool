              An annual school fee per child is set, but this can be paid annually, 
              quarterly or monthly ( over 10 months from February to November) . 
              The same principle applies to the Aftercare service. Parents should anticipate 
              additional expenses to cover insurance, health tests, toiletries, art aprons as 
              well as T-shirts and sweaters. <br></br><br></br>
              School fees are not refundable and a full term's 
              notice in writing required if a child is to be withdrawn from the school. 
              Likewise, the school can insist on a child removal at its discretion, for 
              whatever reason, giving a term's notice. With regard to the Aftercare the 
              withdrawal notice period is a calendar month.<br></br><br></br> The school and Aftercare rely 
              solely on fee payments which go toward the paying of salaries, rental of premises, 
              utilities (water, electricity usage etc), teaching aids and other general expenses. 
              The Governing Body's policy is to set the fees annually so as just to cover budgeted 
              expenditure. No capital reserve is maintained and contingency funds amount to only 10% 
              of the annual budget. A PTA has been established to help raise funds for 
              additional toys, books and equipment
