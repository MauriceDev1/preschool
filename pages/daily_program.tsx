            <p className='text-lg'>Our school follows the calendar set by the Western Cape Education Department for primary and secondary schools.</p>
            <h1 className='text-4xl font-bold mt-10 pb-8'>OUR CLASSES </h1>
            <p className='text-lg'>We offer a two year programme after which time the children should enter Grade R at a primary
              school. Our Younger Group is the 3 and a half to 4 and a half year olds which has a maximum of 20
              children. The Older Group has a maximum of 25 children and caters for the 4 and a half to 6 year
              olds. Each group has a qualified teacher, classroom assistant as well as its own well-equipped
              classroom with fantasy play, construction, and puzzle areas. We have two playgrounds with age
              appropriate jungle gyms, swings, sandpits and other outdoor apparatus for the children to enjoy.</p>
            <h1 className='text-4xl font-bold mt-10 pb-8'>OUR LEARNING PROGRAMME</h1>
            <p className='text-lg'>Our curriculum which is based on the National Framework for Early Learning as set out by the
              Education Department (NELDS and CAPS) is designed to give every child the opportunity to develop
              all the skills, perceptual abilities and concepts that will prepare him/her for future schooling. Written
              progress reports are given to parents three times a year.</p>
